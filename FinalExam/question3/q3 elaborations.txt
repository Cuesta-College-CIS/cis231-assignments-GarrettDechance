Errors:
  when calling getTotalCredits after adding score in, it was producing the sum of the scores. after attempting to fix this by setting it equal to credits, 
  it returns null. Temporarily fixed by adding credits as Integer to Person. I am open to suggestions on how to properly correct this.

Elaboration:
    Reused most code from Quiz 4. Change notes:
    - Course: Create and implement the CourseActivity interface, override the inherited methods, added constructor.
    - Student: Created abstract class Person and made student an extension of it.
        -- toString: added a series of .replace methods to remove the irregular format.
    -Main: Adjusted while loop to allow for new data, i.e score, dob.

    I struggled with this exam despite now understanding the previous quiz. I genuinely don't know why the things that still aren't working
    are continuing to not work.
